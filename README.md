# Student-Performance-Analysis-Visualization-Comparison-System-Using-Python-Matplotlib-and-MySQL
I have done this project using Python and MySQL database primarily.
The Python code uses the 'matplotlib' library to visualize the given data by presenting them in forms of bar charts.
It takes input of student data, compares their performances with one another and also compares with their own previous performances.
